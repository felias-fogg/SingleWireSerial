0.9.1 Initial commit
0.9.1a setRxIntMsk static / recv eliminated
0.9.1b curr deleted
0.9.2 handle_interrupt redesigned (is faster now and terminates earlier)
1.0.0 first publication
1.1.0 Complete redesign of receiving ISR. It is now all inline assembler,
      it uses only 4 registers and employs OCRA for bit timing. Is now millis
      interrupt safe with 125,000 bps and still has one bit time (4
      microseconds) between bytes when working at 250,000 bps with the millis
      interrupt disabled.
