0.9.1 Initial commit
0.9.1a setRxIntMsk static / recv eliminated
0.9.1b curr deleted
0.9.2 handle_interrupt redesigned (is faster now and terminates earlier)
1.0.0 first publication
1.1.0 Complete redesign of receiving ISR. It is now all inline assembler,
      it uses only 4 registers + SREG and employs OCRA for bit timing. Is now millis
      interrupt safe with 125,000 bps and still has one bit time (4
      microseconds) between bytes when working at 250,000 bps with the millis
      interrupt disabled.
1.1.1 Rearranged the initial instructions.
1.1.2 Corrected an annoying typo in the write method that led to the
      problem that the single-wire mode did not work anymore, modified
      the example, and declared setRxIntMsk to be protected so that
      derived classes can use it
1.1.3 fixed the problem that the sending routine starts before the
      stop bit of the receiving byte is fully received, which led to
      problems with debugWIRE
      handle_interrupt is now a private method (as it should!)
